            I juxtapose the legal verses of the constitution and my failed poetry to create a strong dynamic between the three pillars, my poetry, the constitution and the footnotes. The footnotes and the constitution act like a layer glazing over the poetry. Taking
            over the voices that are represented in the poems. Illustrating as a critique on the oppressive patriarchal regime. The stories I wrote can be considered prose poetry neither being poetry nor prose, it is a hybrid of the two writing techniques.
            I’ve chosen this way of writing because it makes it easier to tell things that I cannot directly describe is words. Having an opportunity to make it more metaphoric, it creates a necessary distance from reality. It offers a more distant perspective
            and allows the reader to have a more open mind to it and to create their own emotions. Because it could become a little bit to abstract, I show the videos that I am referring to in my stories to make it clearer what the reality is of the situations
            mentioned in the poems.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >15</font></sup></a><br>
            <br> The reason for choosing this methodology has the following reasons, one being a dialogical one, the quality of being in a dialogue with oneself or viewing things from different perspectives. Living two perspectives means I can look to
            issues from different cultures and adapt to their attitudes and behaviours. Diaspora identities are those which are constantly producing and reproducing themselves anew, through transformation and difference. By the recognition of a necessary
            heterogeneity and diversity; by a conception of ‘identity’ which lives with and through, not despite, difference; by hybridity as Stuart Hall stated.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >16</font></sup></a> This way I have
            an advantage on how to combine values or blend aspects from different cultures that are involved. Navigate through different situations that require different types of behaviour. My story is written from two perspectives. The problematic of
            that from a young Dutch woman experiences, and that from a young Iranian woman. It tells a collective narrative from two different identities as I am writing this text to communicate my experiences and silences.<br>
            <br> Herewith, I further consider also the concept of double-consciousness, a concept that Du Bois developed in order to address the “two-ness” of being. The individual sense of having a feeling as though your identity is divided into several
            parts. Making it difficult or impossible to have a unified identity. Du Bois has recognised that they, black people, in this case, Iranian women, are living through the eyes of another. Their concept of themselves come from what others say
            that they are. It also means that the consciousness is something we develop based on the society we live in.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >17</font></sup></a><br>
            <br> Only a character could claim that Iran is a successful model of a state that is not failing. But somehow, the rich culture of the Iranian identity is carried by poetry; their pride is carried by poetry.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >18</font></sup></a>            The country has an old, Pre-Islamic culture of written poetry and it is of an overwhelming importance. The great works of Persian poetry are more than just the collection of the poets itself. Iranians hear and feel echoes of their historical
            selves in these poems. Poetry from poets like Ferdowsi, who wrote the Persian national epic “Shahnameh” (Book of Kings) in 1010 CE.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >19</font></sup></a> Which tells the hero tales of ancient
            Persia and its kings. To this day this poem is classic way Iranian people recall their nationalism. Generations of Iranians have been reading and listening to this masterwork for more than thousand years. Their lives and poetry resemble each
            other. It is the language of society and a tool that represents their passion and sensitivity. It has been the language of revolutions and became a political action, an act of rebellion and a form of power. Their cultural or nation heroes,
            are not political or religious leaders but their poets. <a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >20</font></sup></a><br>

            <br> For centuries, poets have been writing ghazals. A short poem in which a man often writes about a woman or a feminized lover. And women have been listening to them, provoked them, inspired by them. But rarely created them. Hence, there
            is an inscribed asymmetry to Ghazals. Simin Behbahani is one of the female poets that changed this age-old pattern. She subverts the definition of the ghazal by placing a man at the poem’s centre, demanding a new emotional space for women.
            At the same time, they provide men with the possibility of being the desired object for a change.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >21</font></sup></a><br> The men are being unveiled in her ghazals.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >22</font></sup></a><br>            Among Behbahani, other female poets who challenged gender roles in Persian poetry include Tahirih Qurratul-Ayn (1841-52) Parvin Etesami (1907-41) Forough Farrokhzad (1935-67) <br>

            <br> Their verses are a manifestation of their engaged awareness of the social and political life of Iranians regardless of race, gender, or religion. Many, or most of them have been banned for many years and continued to be censored in Iran.
            They have been given a voice to the yearnings of the Iranian people. As I mentioned before, women have been uprising against the regime and oppression, finding the courage to put their lives in dangerous only to speak out about their rights.
            They are not been doing this as activists but as ordinary women talking from their hearts. The videos later in the text, are showing how the simple acts as wearing nail polish have become a defiance.<br>
            <br> The Iranian constitution was adopted in 1979 after the Islamic revolution and was amended in 1989.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >25</font></sup></a><br> The penal law code was approved by the Islamic Consultancy
            Parliament in 1991.<a href="#ref1"><sup><font color="blue" font size="2em" >26</font></sup></a><br> The constitution contains many laws which restrict the flow of information. These laws are often vaguely worded. This leaves a lot of room
            for interpretation about what is legal and what is not. Not only is it hard for Iranian citizens to understand the laws, it is very unclear what is allowed by the government or not. This way the judges have a lot of room for interpreting what
            is against the law and what the punishment should be. I state the articles as written in the constitution. But in fact, the punishments are way higher most of the time. Because of the ‘freedom’ the judges have to make decisions about punishments
            given.<br>

              15&emsp; General note on the parts forming this thesis: Each chapter is based on a subject that is considered ‘vulgar’ by the Iranian government. By labelling everything in daily life vulgar, they take away the simplest daily life aspects of Iranians.
              The government believes that these subjects are defying Islam. Whenever women, taste the liberty they label it vulgar to keep people in control. If you discard their norms, it will have consequences by law.<br>
