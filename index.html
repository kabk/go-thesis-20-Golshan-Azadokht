          My country, do I belong here?<br>
          <br>
          My thesis brings together narratives from the perspective of a hybrid identity and being conflicted with or exposed to
          gender inequality, segregation, racism and violence in Iran and in the Netherlands<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">1</font>
            </sup>This hybrid identity constitutes
          itself across two cultures and two identities. One of them being, an identity searching for the meaning of belonging.<sup>
            <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">2</font>
          </sup>
          The other, an identity in a veiled society.<sup>
            <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">3</font>
          </sup> Highlighting these differences from my background make me understand the
          connection, of me being an individual woman in-between the two cultures better.<br>
          <br>
          I’ve always found it interesting why women have to conceal their bodies, because of claims that “men cannot control their
          sexuality”. The men have been so powerful throughout history, always dictating the lives of others, of women. Not only
          in Iran but, in all societies, we have been dealing with dominance by men and overwhelming control by men. With this
          thesis I saw an opportunity to address this issue by using poetry (what paradoxically enough has been an important part
          of Iranian culture), to create my own ghazals.<sup>
            <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">4</font>
          </sup> Today, Iranian women are “repressed prisoners” of a patriarchal culture
          that traditionally prevents the growth of female subjects. This for me was reason enough to write about my own experiences.<br>
          <br>
          I will take the reader through a poetic narrative of realities in what I coin “a veiled society”. Within the space of
          my layout of this thesis I experiment with the footnotes and the legal paragraphs of the Iranian constitution (Sharia),
          and thus make it more understandable and show how these vague constitutions and laws forcefully suppress Iranian people
          and their right to speak up. Therefore, through the notion of fiction, I am able to be a voice to the voiceless, to
          symbolize what has been taken away by the laws of the constitution.<sup>

          1.&emsp;Stuart Hall coins the term hybridity in his essay Cultural Identity and Diaspora.<br>
            <br>
            2.&emsp;Bell Hooks, in her book Belonging: A Culture of Place, talks about the notion of belonging, having a place and of feeling that you are allowed to be yourself there. Her discussion of trauma and the need for psychological healing
            is also a key driving force behind her discussion of the need to both find a place to belong and a place of community.<br>

            4.&emsp;Ghazal derives from my understanding of a short poem most likely about love, beauty and women (often) written by men.<br>
            <br>
            5.&emsp;My intent is neither to insult the religion Islam as such, nor any religious subject, nor to make statements against this religion. Instead, my focus lies on the problematic regime in the Islamic Republic of Iran that the Iranian
            people are facing. It is a personal account, written – from my point of view as an Iranian woman – who has grown up in the Netherlands.<br>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class='panel panel3'>Growing up Iranian in the Netherlands, has left me always questioning my identity from different perspectives. Religion,
          gender, aesthetics, culture and history. What do these ideas mean to me as an individual? I have the habit of seeing my
          country of origin through a western view, and the “west” through my heritage background, Iranian eyes. I find myself mentally
          and emotionally being conflicted between these two worlds that are so opposite of each other in every possible way you can
          imagen. I have noticed I act differently in every situation. In Iran I become a very shy person, while in the Netherlands I
          can be quite outspoken. Jill Soloway argues, that women have been feeling as a subject, of the cis male telling us how to
          behave in certain situations.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">6</font>
            </sup> These behaviours have made me realise I’ve been in search of an identity between two cultures,
          in my body. Where do I belong? <br>
          <br>
          Growing up in a small village, being part of the small group of immigrants might play a role in what belonging means to me.
          What you have in common or what differentiates you with people around you shapes you as a person. Thus, belonging plays a role
          in connecting individuals to the social. It involves the sense of identification, recognizing with one another.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">7</font>
            </sup>
          And I’ve never felt in place in that sense. Gloria Wekker stated in her book White Innocence that in Dutch common sense, the remarkable thing
          is that when ethnicity is invoked, it is always “they”, the other, the allochtonen, who are referenced, not autochtonen. It is
          still whites, and the others.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">8</font>
            </sup>Maybe it is this, that has been unconsciously a state of mind, for not feeling like I belong.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">9</font>
            </sup>
          I’ve always felt the unease of claiming home of both locations and identities. I feel both the shame of being Iranian and also
          denying being part of the Dutch culture. A question often asked to allochtonen, “where are you from?” and then when asked again
          “No, but where are you really from?” has been a problematic situation that the person, having a color has been dealing with.
          Always apologizing for giving the wrong answer. Laughing it off as if it is oke we have been put in this situation in the first place.

          My memories make me feel alive, they give my identity meaning. Without these memories my identity is even more scattered. They
          are my legacy, just like I inherited my parents their memories. I find myself clinging on to my heritage. Wearing, showing,
          cooking and sharing the many things that my heritage cultured passed down on me, it helps me make up my personal presence,
          helping me to understand myself. Cultural historian Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argued<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">10</font>
            </sup>that we are attached to these trinkets
          because they keep us grounded in the present and help us remember the past. In that sense, the objects or way of acting becomes
          a vital role in how we construct our sense of self. It is a performance to understand myself better. <br>
          <br>
          For Iranians poetry is a way they remember themselves, they see poetry as an important aspect of who they are. It has
          become a collective memory and is an art form in itself. The culture that I so badly wanted to be part of, in fact, I
          was unable to be a part of because this important aspect of the culture that remains in parts hermetic to me. The language
          to me, was never part of my identity. Even though, it was the only way of communication with my family. I had to find my way
          in expressing complicated situations in easy words. This left me with a lot of frustrations and miscommunications. But lately,
          as I grow older, I discover more beauty in the phrases that I use. Something simple as “I miss you” “Delam basad tang shode”
          literally translated “My heart is shrinking for you”. It has become more and more one of those trinkets that keep me connected
          to my heritage culture. The language marks the absence of the heritage land. And honours its traditions and values. <br>
          <br>
          I grew up with a lot of respect for my family and Iranian culture. Being very close with my family, aunt’s, cousins,
          they always give me tons of love, support and encouragement. However, I don’t admire everything about Iranian culture.
          As I am growing older and having the luck of looking from an outsider perspective, I am understanding the reality of woman
          in Iran more. The shifts between countries as child has shaped my thoughts on this subject and how much is being taken from
          the society especially their women. This always makes me question “what if I grew up in Iran as a woman?”.
          Ending up thinking about how grateful I am for the possibility to decide for myself, what I think about religion, human rights,
          and being able to speak up. And how important it is for exiled people to discuss this subject matter to give a voice to the
          women of Iran. For this reason, I am using memories, events and artist that deal with this matter, to represent to struggle of
          Iranian women. Many artists use the political issues to feel impowered.<br>
          <br>
          Shirin Neshat, who is an Iranian exiled visual artist, argues that within oppressed societies, culture becomes more activated.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">11</font>
            </sup>
          It serves a purpose and there is more demand for it. It helps the people to remain inspired and helpful. I’ve noticed that many
          of the works I make, the focus lays on the same subjects, the problematic of an oppressed society. <br>
          <br>
          When you look at the Iranian history of poetry there is always this manifestation of pain or darkness.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">12</font>
            </sup> They are echoes of
          ur own griefs. And the violence and pain that the Iranian society has been through. The men have been so powerful throughout
          history, always dictating the lives of others. The last 40 years, all that the Iranian people have gotten from the government
          was oppression.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">13</font>
            </sup> Which is the complete opposite of the perception the world has. Looking at the recent upraising’s in the
          country, you see that the women are fighters and unafraid to speak up about the problems and oppression they face.<sup>

            12&emsp;(S. Sylwia, 2014) “Also the richness of vocabulary relating to sadness is reflected in the whole Persian literature. It is one of the most important spheres of Persian culture where the notion of sorrow becomes manifested so
            clearly. At the same time, it is also one of the most significant sources of knowledge about the culture of Iran, including the concept of sadness. Although poets underline the value of sadness, at the same time, they perceive it as a
            difficult and painful feeling. Sadness in Persian poetry has been repeatedly described as intense suffering, a severe force that is difficult to endure.”<br>

        <div class='panel panel4'>I juxtapose the legal verses of the constitution and my failed poetry to create a strong dynamic between the three
          pillars, my poetry, the constitution and the footnotes. The footnotes and the constitution act like a layer glazing
          over the poetry. Taking over the voices that are represented in the poems. Illustrating as a critique on the oppressive
          patriarchal regime. The stories I wrote can be considered prose poetry neither being poetry nor prose, it is a hybrid
          of the two writing techniques. I’ve chosen this way of writing because it makes it easier to tell things that I cannot
          directly describe is words. Having an opportunity to make it more metaphoric, it creates a necessary distance from reality.
          It offers a more distant perspective and allows the reader to have a more open mind to it and to create their own emotions.
          Because it could become a little bit to abstract, I show the videos that I am referring to in my stories to make it clearer
          what the reality is of the situations mentioned in the poems.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">15</font>
            </sup><br>
          <br>
          The reason for choosing this methodology has the following reasons, one being a dialogical one, the quality of being in a dialogue with
          oneself or viewing things from different perspectives. Living two perspectives means I can look to issues from different cultures
          and adapt to their attitudes and behaviours. Diaspora identities are those which are constantly producing and reproducing
          themselves anew, through transformation and difference. By the recognition of a necessary heterogeneity and diversity; by a
          conception of ‘identity’ which lives with and through, not despite, difference; by hybridity as Stuart Hall stated.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">16</font>
            </sup> This way I have an advantage on how to combine values or blend aspects from different cultures that are involved. Navigate through
          different situations that require different types of behaviour. My story is written from two perspectives. The problematic
          of that from a young Dutch woman experiences, and that from a young Iranian woman. It tells a collective narrative from two
          different identities as I am writing this text to communicate my experiences and silences.<br>
          <br>
          Herewith, I further consider also the concept of double-consciousness, a concept that Du Bois developed in order to address the
          “two-ness” of being. The individual sense of having a feeling as though your identity is divided into several parts. Making
          it difficult or impossible to have a unified identity. Du Bois has recognised that they, black people, in this case, Iranian
          women, are living through the eyes of another. Their concept of themselves come from what others say that they are. It also
          means that the consciousness is something we develop based on the society we live in.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">17</font>
            </sup><br>
          <br>
          Only a character could claim that Iran is a successful model of a state that is not failing. But somehow, the rich culture of
          the Iranian identity is carried by poetry; their pride is carried by poetry.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">18</font>
            </sup> The country has an old, Pre-Islamic culture of
          written poetry and it is of an overwhelming importance. The great works of Persian poetry are more than just the collection
          of the poets itself. Iranians hear and feel echoes of their historical selves in these poems. Poetry from poets like Ferdowsi,
          who wrote the Persian national epic “Shahnameh” (Book of Kings) in 1010 CE.<sup>
              <font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">19</font>
            </sup> Which tells the hero tales of ancient Persia and its
          kings. To this day this poem is classic way Iranian people recall their nationalism. Generations of Iranians have been reading
          and listening to this masterwork for more than thousand years. Their lives and poetry resemble each other. It is the language of
          society and a tool that represents their passion and sensitivity. It has been the language of revolutions and became a political
          action, an act of rebellion and a form of power. Their cultural or nation heroes, are not political or religious leaders but their
          poets.<sup>

          For centuries, poets have been writing ghazals. A short poem in which a man often writes about a woman or a feminized lover.
          And women have been listening to them, provoked them, inspired by them. But rarely created them. Hence, there is an inscribed
          asymmetry to Ghazals. Simin Behbahani is one of the female poets that changed this age-old pattern. She subverts the definition
          of the ghazal by placing a man at the poem’s centre, demanding a new emotional space for women. At the same time, they provide
          men with the possibility of being the desired object for a change.<sup><font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">21</font></sup>The men are being unveiled in her ghazals.<sup><font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">22</font></sup> Among Behbahani,
          other female poets who challenged gender roles in Persian poetry include Tahirih Qurratul-Ayn (1841-52) Parvin Etesami (1907-41) Forough Farrokhzad (1935-67) <br>

          Their verses are a manifestation of their engaged awareness of the social and political life of Iranians regardless of race,
          gender, or religion. Many, or most of them have been banned for many years and continued to be censored in Iran. They have been
          given a voice to the yearnings of the Iranian people. As I mentioned before, women have been uprising against the regime and
          oppression, finding the courage to put their lives in dangerous only to speak out about their rights. They are not been doing
          this as activists but as ordinary women talking from their hearts. The videos later in the text, are showing how the simple acts
          as wearing nail polish have become a defiance.<br>

          The Iranian constitution was adopted in 1979 after the Islamic revolution and was amended in 1989.<sup><font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">25</font></sup><br> The penal law code was
          approved by the Islamic Consultancy Parliament in 1991.<sup><font color="#145A32" font size="5vw">26</font></sup><br> The constitution contains many laws which restrict the flow of
          information. These laws are often vaguely worded. This leaves a lot of room for interpretation about what is legal and what
          is not. Not only is it hard for Iranian citizens to understand the laws, it is very unclear what is allowed by the government
          or not. This way the judges have a lot of room for interpreting what is against the law and what the punishment should be.
          I state the articles as written in the constitution. But in fact, the punishments are way higher most of the time. Because of
          the ‘freedom’ the judges have to make decisions about punishments given.<br>

            15&emsp; General note on the parts forming this thesis: Each chapter is based on a subject that is considered ‘vulgar’ by
            the Iranian government. By labelling everything in daily life vulgar, they take away the simplest daily life aspects
            of Iranians. The government believes that these subjects are defying Islam. Whenever women, taste the liberty they label
            it vulgar to keep people in control. If you discard their norms, it will have consequences by law.<br>

          If you separate women from men, they will never learn how to interact with each other in a normal way. And this
          will lead to dangerous situations. Not only will they not learn how to interact with each other but I also believe
          it is belittling, and the more you belittle a woman, the more she starts believing she is the belittled woman. The
          degradation created by men and his masculine power in society, in this sense becomes a part of the women’s psyche.
          Women are consistently punished more often than men by the morality police to maintain a stronger control on women’s
          social freedoms. Making public space less safe for women by making the men feel like they can assault her in public
          places because they consider the public space their original domain. They start believing that any woman who dares to
          enter their domain might as well be prepared for the “consequences”.<br>

          <p style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"> The East Without the West</p>
          While the Shah, the king of Iran before the revolution in 1979 constantly focused on westernization and modernizing the
          country, the leader of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini declared that the Shah was destructing Islam in Iran by
          doing so. Westernization was at the core of the cultural revolution for Iran. To prevent westernization in the Iranian
          culture anything that in the eyes of the regime was western was being implemented by Islamic values.<br>

          People in Iran are angry, especially the women, they have always been looking for change. A change that will bring a
          better life and better rights. No longer do they want to be seen as weak and as a dependent creature. Which is why a lot
          of women have been standing up for their rights and against the oppression trying over and over again to achieve their goals. <br>

          <p style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"> Man and “Wife”</p>
          Having a relationship is not something similar as one that would occur in the Netherlands. Having a lot of strict
          rules controlling social lives puts a lot of pressure on young couples. Reflecting upon relationships that couples
          enter and the rules that they have to obey made me understand the problematic obstacles for women in relationships,
          such as having almost no right on legal decisions about themselves and their legal status in a relationship. <br>

              Article 1: The government of Iran is an Islamic Republic, which the nation of Iran based on its
              long-held belief in the rule of the truth and the justice of the Qu’ran, and after its victorious
              Islamic revolution, under the leadership of marja’-e taqlīd the exalted Grand Ayatollah Imam Khomeini,
              has established. The measure was ratified by the 98.2 percent affirmative vote of all the eligible
              voters in a referendum that was held on the 10th and the 11th of Farvardīn in the year 1358 of the
              solar Islamic calendar, agnate to the first and the second of jumādī al-awlā’ in the year 1399 of the
              lunar Islamic calendar.<br>
              <br>
              Article 14: According to the Qur’an: “Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for
              (your) faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them. For Allah loveth
              those who are just” (80: 8), the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Muslims are required to treat
              the non-Muslim individuals with good conduct, in fairness and Islamic justice, and must respect their human rights.
              This principle is valid for those persons who have not conspired or acted against Islam and the Islamic Republic of Iran.<br>

            28&emsp;(A. Najmabi 2010) "What can the transformations in the flag of Iran tells us about the gender modernity and
            the modern notions of gender in Iran is visible in the changes over the centuries? In 1836 Muhammad Shah Qajar (r. 1834–48)
            formally adopted the lion and sun as the official emblem of the Iranian state. The lion was male, the sun was female.
            Over the following century the sun burst into a magnificent Qajari female face, and the lion became more masculinized.
            By the early twentieth century, however, the sun gradually lost its hair and distinct facial features and was left with
            two dots for eyes and a few marks for a nose and mouth. These remaining features were permanently erased sometime in 1935–36,
            and by the late 1970s, the emblem was fully geometrized. In the aftermath of the 1979 revolution, the lion and sun were
            finally abandoned as the state emblem, replaced by a calligraphic depiction of the sentence “There is no god but Allah.”
            In this example it is very clear, how the importance of women in the Iranian society has lost it’s importance and position
            in being part of the society." <br>

            arrest, and physical attacks, hence the #MyCameraIsMyWeapon movement started. Where women use the hashtag to share their footage.
            The message of these videos are very clear and very specific, that women want to be able to choose if they wear hijab or not.
            They want to publicly denounce the morality police and their acts and abuse towards women who are not dressed the way they want
            them to be dressed. Even though Iran has a major economic crisis which is spreading across the land, the only concern of the
            government seems to be the hijab. Nonetheless, the issue is beyond the issue of hijab and the control of what women wear.
            The Islamic law favors men over women, in marriage and divorce laws, women can’t travel without permission of the husband or
            father, and when a government decides a woman is worth half a man this will create an attitude that women are being treated
            like second-class citizens.<br>

            30&emsp;Farzaneh Milani. “Veils and Words: The Emerging Voices of Iranian Women Writers” (1992) P25<br>
            <br>
            31&emsp;The Women of Allah photographs from artist Shirin Neshat, consist out of three elements: the veil, the weapon and the written
            text. The photographs are both intimate and confrontational. They reflect the traditional repressed status of women in Iran
            and their power. The text, which is revealed on her skin, on the visible body parts – the only parts of a woman that are allowed
            to be visible according to the mandatory dress code – is written poetry by woman Iranian writers. The male gaze in the context
            of Shirin Neshat’s work becomes a sign of sexuality, sin, shame and power. In Neshat’s work, the women returns the gaze, breaking
            free from centuries of subservience to male or European desire. Her veil does not stanch her sexuality, her gaze is bold and
            faces the danger. The work constructs a layered image from Islamic culture, not only referring to Iran and the Iranian women
            but also images for the “Other” the “Muslim other” The visual symbols became a representation of the Muslim societies. The
            images become stereotypical oriental for the viewer regardless of the artist’s intentions. <br>

            This mindset that is visible is defined by Edward Said as “Orientalism” the western attitude that views Eastern societies
            as primitive, exotic and inferior. In this case the covered woman indicates that it is located in the Middle East, the
            primitive, “the Other”. Said argues that the west, looks at the countries and the people through a lens that distorts the
            actual reality of those places and the people. He calls this lens Orientalism. The way we use to understand the unfamiliar
            and strange. The people of the Middle East appear different and threatening. The countries that appear different and
            threatening are in fact very different than people imagen. She appears dangerous, she might be a religious fanatic, the
            construction of a Jihad, a terrorist. Yet, her photographs not only deconstruct stereotypical Western representations of the
            Middle East, but also explore the complex position, role, and ideological context of women in Iranian society.<br>
            <br>
            32&emsp;Belonging, in the book and movie Persepolis Marjane Satrapi sketches a great example of what this exactly means.
            The story focuses on the experiences of a young girl growing up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Her story tells
            the impact of war and religious extremism on Iranians, especially women. When the Islamic regime took over. Everyone who
            supported the revolution was then an enemy of the government. In the book, Satrapi has left Iran with the idea of leaving
            the “religious country searching for an open Europe”. During her years there, these ideas are tested as Marjane faces other
            challenges to her survival, such as racism, physical and psychic homelessness and heartbreak. Throughout the book Marjane
            is seen to frequently be in conflict with herself, her surroundings, and the people around her. She got rejected as a
            western decadent, and belonged nowhere. When you get into a new culture, you want to integrate. You almost feel like you
            have to forget about your first culture. And then you lose your identity, you don’t know who you are anymore. When you leave,
            and come back, you are a foreigner everywhere. <br>

            34&emsp;Forouhar is an artist that often plays with identity. In the project Signes she shows a set of pictograms that serve to overcome
            language barriers. But in her pictograms, she shows how we make distinctions are problematic. The fact that the women are wearing
            the chador shows that these signs are located in the Middle East. This addresses stereotyping of gender roles in Islamic
            ountries. The space of the women in the signs are restricted and they have way less space than the men. The male and female
            spaces are being defined by a red line which immediately indicates the male has more space. The veil indicates the boundary
            between the private and the public. In this respect, the signs are signs of gender difference. But the signs also draw otherness.
            The male figures are not specifically designated as Arabs but represent a universal standard. It is the feminine that embodies
            otherness, the Muslim other. “What is disturbing is that such patterns are by no means unusual otherwise, how could we possibly
            read the pictograms at all?” (Forouhar) The distinctions we make address the problematic gender hierarchy and the otherness
            in stereotyping.<br>

            <br>
            36&emsp;Everything that has to do with the west, is in the eyes of the Iranian authorities equate with the ‘great Satan’. For the
            young generation, in particular for the women, fashion items become a kind of passive rebellion. Because the mandatory hijab
            leaves nothing but the small circle of the face, it became the only way for self-expression. Iranian women have become obsessed
            with their faces because it is the only part of their body they can show. Trying to do everything to make it more delicate,
            symmetrical and European by changing a lot through plastic surgery and makeup. It is not much about vanity, but it becomes
            the desire to join a class of Iranians, who look European, travel, have money and live Western lives. Shirin Aliabadi, shows
            young women who are attempting to explode the restraining of religious regulations. From clothing, to relationships with the
            other sex, the whole of life is regulated. The artist states “I don’t believe that you automatically become a rebel with a
            Hermès scarf around your neck, but in the context of the society in which we grew up, within an educational system that has
            different values to those in the West, the phenomenon of fashion turns into an interesting paradox. But ultimately, these
            young women’s concern is not to overthrow the government but to have fun.”<br>

            38&emsp;The Iranian rapper Amir Tataloo released a new music video the day before the Iran deal was finalized on 14 July 2015.
            (Iran agreed a long-term deal on its nuclear program with a group of world powers) The music video was called Nuclear
            Energy and took the Iranian web sphere by storm. The video features members of the Islamic republic navy on a warship
            singing “This is our absolute right, to have an armed Persian Gulf”. The video and song had support from the regime and
            its military apparatus. It shocked many Iranians, given that officials have labeled rappers as “westernised”.<br>
            <br>
            Amir Tataloo had been making music underground and was arrested in 2013 for cooperating with foreign satellite stations. The song appears
            to be confusing when it came out. But it was not, it was a strategy for the regime to gain support from Iran’s youthful
            population. Since a large number of young Iranians are not responding to media that the Islamic regime labeled “sacred”.
            If a nation was to attack Iran, would young Iranians rise up to defend their notion? The answer being no, they realised
            they have to start speaking the language of the youth. Entertain them with propaganda made in their language, because
            this youngest generation doesn’t understand their religious language.<br>

            39&emsp;Women in Iran are not allowed to sing, perform solo or produce their own music due to the Islamic Regulations in effect
            since the revolution, the only way they can sing is as backing singer but never on their own. Conservative clerics say women’s
            voices have the potential to trigger immoral sensual arousal. Newsha Tavakolian focuses on these women singers by taking
            photos of them performing in their minds in front of a large audience, in reality this was taking place in a small private
            studio downtown Tehran. She made CD covers for each of the women, which was her own interpretation of the society she lives in.
            The CD cases that she made, are (for now) empty.<br>

            40&emsp;To come back to the term Westernization. In the second half of the twentieth century, western music was very popular. Western
            pop music sung by Iranian “pop” stars as Ebi, Dariush, Googoosh (most of them live in exile now) may be one of the reasons for
            the violent reaction of the revolution in 1979. “Going back to our roots” Khomeini (He was the founder of the Islamic Republic
            of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution) had always critized this Westernization and called it “the culture of
            foreigners” (Youssefzadeh, 2000) A great example of the “westernized” Iranian pop artists is the video by Khruangbin that brings
            together multiple of these (female) artists from before the revolution in their video.<br>
            <br>
            “Music is like a drug, whoever acquires the habit can no longer devote himself to important activities. It changes people to
            the point of yielding to vice or to preoccupations pertaining to the world of music alone. We must eliminate music because it
            means betraying our country and our youth. We must completely eliminate it” - Ayatollah Khomeini <br>
            <br>
            Which resulted in no more concerts, radio and television broadcast and popular music were banned, singing became a sin. For
            this reason, many artists had to leave the country to avoid being arrested, they turn their backs to Iran, and give concerts
            outside of Iran for the exiled community. The ban applies to state-run radio and TV, but Iranians with satellite dishes were
            still be able to receive broadcasts originating outside the country. For a short period, the Iranian authorities would
            aggressively barge into people’s houses to take the satellite dishes away. The government believed that spreading corruption,
            robbing youths and decadent clothing and sexual problems were all bred by satellite television. But people kept buying new
            satellites unwilling to surrender for their cultural freedoms.<br>

            The government wants to defend all Islamic cultural values. The Islamic system in Iran says that anyone who works in
            underground music is not only a Satanist but a kaffir. A kaffir is someone who rejects or disbelieves in Allah. In the
            Islamic Republic, anyone wanting to form a group, regardless of the musical genre, has to go to the Ministry and fill in
            the relevant forms. Each group member has to be approved, as does their music, their lyrics and their clothing. Rock or
            metal musicians are still, moreover, considered by some authorities to be devil worshippers, so many Iranian bands do not
            even bother asking for the mandatory government permits to release their music and seek contracts with foreign companies.
            Going against these rules, can cause you a lot of problems, one of them being charged with Satanism, and leave with a
            punishment of imprisonment, a fine and lashing. Underground music is a mirror of Iran’s current society situation.
            And artists express their reality in their music, because they are not allowed to say it. This is a sense of freedom young
            Iranians are feeling and why more of the youth is hungry for underground music. The rebellious and angry music is thriving
            in Iran, and it being monitored, is not holding anyone back from doing it.<br>

            42&emsp;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the 2009 Iranian presidential re-election. People believed that the election was rigged.
            This event emerged an uprising of millions of people going out in the streets to protest. People took to the streets
            with the slogan “Where is my vote?” Not only was it a protest against the election results, but it was also a reason to
            go against the repressive presence of the government in their lives. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, arrested
            thousands of protesters, dozens of whom lost their lives. These protests became known as the “green movement”. A video
            of Neda Agha-Soltani death during these protests circulated around the world. Her fate became a voice for the women, who
            were leading the many protests throughout Iran. She became an instant symbol of the antigovernment movement. 10 years later,
            the Islamic Republic’s basic character remains unchanged, still silencing people. Still the policymakers remain occupied
            with how women dress, still occupied with the deeply rooted westernization. Every time, these protests happen the amount
            of violence used by the regime is a way to shut the people up. Bringing an end to every upstanding of the people. Protesters
            are willing to sacrifice their times, but many are not willing to sacrifice their lives and their future. The regime, on the
            other hand would fight to retain the grip. Making it very hard for people to make a change.<br>

              receive the designated punishment, but if he or she repeats his or her confession fewer than four lashes, the punishment

              On the issue of marriage, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintains that a child is defined in terms of Sharia laws.
              Accordingly, a boy child is defined to be below the age of 15 lunar years, or 14 years and 7 months, and a girl child
              is defined to be below the age of 9 lunar years, or 8 years and 9 months. This contradicts the definition of a child as
              set out in the Convention and violates its implementation at the national and local levels. According to the Islamic
              Republic civil code, the legal age of marriage in Iran is set at age 13 for girls and age 15 for boys. However, the same
              Act allows girls below the age of 13 and boys below the age of 15 to be wed, conditioned on the consent of their father
              and the permission of a judge.<br></p>

        <div class='panel panel10'>As I walk away from the house my aunt pours a clear glass filled with water behind me, a flow of water follows
          my steps as they close the gate. Another place, closing its doors on me. The water symbolizes
          the ensures a safe return home. I kiss and pass under the Koran three times, for protection. But also,
          a goodbye to the oppression exercised by the laws based on the name of this book. A goodbye to the
          oppression in a country that focuses on the fear of foreign influence and westernization. I go off, only to find myself as
          an allochtoon in the west. <br>
          <br>
          As I have shown in my thesis, the characteristics of the traditional Persian ghazal, has been a tool to
          show how words can become a strong ingredient for meaning, to criticize the construct of the female status and the possessive
          power of men. It is not only the basic problems in the country, apart from the regime and the government, it is the patriarchal
          culture that leads the country, the culture that cares more about westernization than their own people. It says the woman is more
          sensitive than the man. A woman still will be worth half a man. The women is being dominated. Under the male gaze, we are being
          denied of our individuality and our humanity. <br>

          The revolution of 1979 awakened hope, but it turned out the Islamic regime was a setback. The Islamic Republic has not succeeded
          in following a consistent line on human rights. The conflict between the demanding people and the supremacy of the Islamic regime
          are like a never-ending clash. Even with the latest uprisings, it seems like it will be a long way till it will be resolved in any
          kind of way. The human rights violations continue on the name of the sharia law. Religion is a very personal affair, and it should
          stay close to yourself, the second it becomes public. It will be no good. So my intensions, with writing this thesis was showing
          what happens when it becomes public, when extremists impose it on you.<br>
          <br>
          The contradictions between violence and empowerment, love and suppression being the foundation of poetry became the foundation
          of my thesis. It structured my thesis playing with the importance of the text and making a reference to the statement of a
          ghazal being made by men and not women. It served to challenge the suppression of female voices. And argue the ridiculousness
          of how a vague constitution can have grip on a society. I will no longer withhold my critical views. Iranian women, whether
          veiled or not, at home or in exile are telling their stories more than ever before speaking up about their realities and values,
          no longer willing to mute their voices, silenced by the patriarchy. Under the female gaze, we dare to express our thoughts and
          feelings, we dare to be seen on our own terms. Women’s issues are important to both the traditional, and the modern of the
          society. So the pressure for expanded, better rights will continue, no matter who is in power.<br>
